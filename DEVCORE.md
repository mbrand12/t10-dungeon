#T10-dungeon Development Diary

## Motivation

  After making a text-adventure ruby program the next task was to extract a
  interesting part of that program (namely the dungeon generator) as a gem, and
  use that to learn more about gems, and how they work.

  Creating a gem was made easy with [bundler](http://bundler.io/)'s `bundle gem
  t10-dungeon` command, but using it in [T10](https://github.com/mbrand12/t10)
  was much harder than it seemed.

  First of all I had problems with making the needed required properly, one of
  the reasons for that not working properly was the way the files where
  requireable in the `t10-dungeon.gemspec`.

  Namely the `spec.files` uses a `$ git lf-files` in order to list the files
  and since I haven't added the new files (`dungeon/generator.rb` and
  `dungeon.traversable.rb`) via `$ git add -A` it didn't register.

  The second problem was the need to use `require "bundle/setup"` where for the
  other gems like `pry` and `minitest` I didn't have to use that command, and
  since I wanted to emulate other gems that needed to be changed.

  The problem was that I used that gem locally via `gem "t10-dungeon", :path =>
  "path"` in the `Gemfile`.

  The reason other gems are just able to be required without being loaded to the
  path with `require "bundler/setup"` is that RubyGems overwrites the
  `Kernel.require` method searching the installed gems for the file needed.

  So the solution (localy) was to build gem using `$ gem build` and then
  locally installing that gam with `gem install path/to/t10-dungeon.gem`. You
  can read more about the about gem activation
  [here](http://erik.hollensbe.org/2013/05/11/gem-activation-and-you/).

  The third layer is that when the gem is not hosted on RubyGems instead of
  being installed to `vendor/gems` it will be installed to
  `vendor/bundler/gems/` making it unable to be required by the RubyGems
  overwritten `Kernel.require` so again `require bundler/setup` must be used.
