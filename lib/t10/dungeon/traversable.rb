module T10
  module Dungeon
    # The methods in this module are used to connect a Room to another Room
    # (making them traversable) while ensuring that the connection goes both
    # ways and takes care of internal and external orientations. The connection
    # is assigned to the instance variable @door, which a class that includes
    # this module must declare within the constructor (the class also must
    # include @has_left, @has_right and @has_ahead instance variables within
    # the constructor)
    #
    # Each room can have up to 4 doors, each door takes one cardinal direction
    # and requires that the room connected to that door follows that logic. In
    # other words if one exits via the east door it will come in the next room
    # via the west entrance.
    #
    # An origin door leads to the room that leads to the entrance room (the
    # first room in the dungeon). The origin door provides the means of
    # internal orientation without being dependent on the external orientation.
    # The narration in the room should always be made with that in mind (write
    # the description as if the Hero is always with his back turned on the
    # origin door).
    #
    # So regardless of external orientation of the room (east, west, north,
    # south) the internal orientation will always be the same. That way if a
    # specific room always has a door on the left it will have it regardless of
    # its external orientation (or rotation).
    #
    # An example of the @doors instance variable that holds the connections:
    #
    #     # The keys are the external orientation.
    #     # The second value is the internal rotation that is relative to the
    #     # :origin. The :ahead will always be the opposite cardinal direction
    #     # from the : origin, same with :to_right and :to_left. So if the
    #     # :origin is :west the :ahead is :east.
    #     #
    #     # The third value is the reference to the instance of the room the
    #     # door leads to. Weather the value gets assigned here is dependent on
    #     # weather the room has that door via the @has_left, @has_right, and
    #     # @has_ahead boolean instance variables of the class that includes
    #     # this module.
    #
    #
    #     # before connecting using {connect_to}
    #     @doors = {
    #        east:   [values],
    #        south:  [values],
    #        west:   [values],
    #        north:  [values]
    #     }
    #     # after
    #     @doors = {
    #        east:   [values, :ahead, nil],
    #        south:  [values, :to_right, nil],
    #        west:   [values, :origin, origin_room],
    #        north:  [values, :to_left, nil]
    #     }
    #
    # These methods are used only when generating the dungeon, and should only
    # be used by the dungeon generator.
